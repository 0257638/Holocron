## Specific Implementation

As with other areas of Programming, Web Development can have different focuses or paths to choose from. The focus of this course is learning the fundamentals of HTML, CSS and Javascript, and later on, learning Python.
## Website Development - A Brief Overview

There are two main areas of website development - Front End and Back End. 

**Front End Development** is what the end-user sees. This is referred to as client-side, meaning the code runs in the browser. Development in this area focuses on the aesthetics of the website - how the website looks and feels.

**Back End Development** is server-side. This area of development focuses on databases and providing data to the front end. The code runs on the server. 

Over the year, this course focuses on both front end and back end development.

Developers who code both front end and back end are referred to as **full stack developers.**

## Front End Development - A Brief Overview

**HTML** (HyperText Markup Language) is used to create the structure and content of the web page. It is used to define what is being shown and where.

**CSS** (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to tell the browser how to display the content. For instance: The font size, colour spacing, background colour and much more.

**JavaScript** is used to add interactivity and some dynamic content. 

These are the three main categories of code in this phase of the course.

## Back End Development - A Brief Overview

Back End development usually focuses on coding secure, controllable access to a database. 

Example programming languages are **Python**, **PHP**. 

Databases are critical in any moderately sized web application to store and provide data to the user. Some example database systems are MySQL, MariaDB, Postgres, SQLite.

**Structured Query Language (SQL)** is the standard language to provide access to a database.
