Edit the file on the left, describing the project. It doesn’t need to be detailed - just a short description of the repository.

## Commit and Push

Commit the changes by clicking the green tick button in the top left of the window.

Enter a description of the commit you’re making. If it’s the first time you’re committing a file, you can just use the message “init” indicating it’s the initial version of the file.

Click **Commit and Push**. 

This will update the local (on your hard disk) version of the repository.

Confirm the Push.

This will then push the changes to GitHub. This will make the two copies of the repository identical.

You can visit your repository on [Github.com](http://Github.com) and you should see the changes made in the README.md.
