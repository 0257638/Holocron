## Specific Implementation

In Javascript, the conventions for naming items are:

| Variables | lowerCamelCase |
| --- | --- |
| Constants | ALL_CAPITALS |
| Functions | lowerCamelCase |

It is also standard convention to include comment blocks at the top of the code to explain the code, but also to include function header comments to explain the purpose of each function.

## Example

```jsx
/**
    * Returns x raised to the n-th power.
    *
    * @param {number} x The number to raise.
    * @param {number} n The power, must be a natural number.
    * @return {number} x raised to the n-th power.
    */
function pow(x, n) {
    ...
}
```
