# Specific Implementation

Javascript is similar to C and C++ in terms of the syntax and structure, however Javascript typically runs in the browser as client-side (or front-end) scripting. Javascript can also be run on servers.

Consider the following code:

## Brackets

Notice the use of brackets - () and {} - these are very important in the Javascript language (as they are in C and C++). 

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Each open bracket, whichever type, must have a corresponding close bracket.

</aside>

The standard brackets - or parentheses - indicate **conditions** and **parameters** and **arguments**. 

The Curly Brackets - { and } - indicate the start and the end of a code block. This code block can be a **function** (as can be seen in the code sample - `ShowMessage()`)

```jsx
function ShowMessage() {

    for(var i = 0; i < arguments.length; i++){
        alert(arguments[i]);
    }
}

ShowMessage("Steve", "Jobs");
```

## Semicolon

The details of these topics will be discussed later in the course - just be aware of the different brackets and their uses at this stage.

You may also notice that *almost* each line of code shown ends with a semi-colon. In C-based languages (Java, javascript, Arduino etc), the semi-colon identifies the end of a statement.

## Whitespace

In programming, whitespace refers to the use of indentation (tabs), space characters new newline characters.

In Javascript, the browser generally ignores whitespace, meaning you can have as many blank lines in your code as you wish - the code will still compile.

Indentation is also not critical, however it makes it easier to read code blocks if indented correcty.
