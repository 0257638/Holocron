Karnaugh Maps,A method to minimise Boolean expressions in a simple table form.,
NOT Gate,"The NOT gate simply ""flips"" the input, so TRUE becomes FALSE, and FALSE becomes TRUE.",
AND Gate,"An AND gate takes two inputs and produces a single output. For the output to be TRUE, then both of the inputs have to be TRUE.",
NOR Gate,"The combination of an OR gate with a NOT gate, so it is the opposite of an OR gate. ",
NAND Gate,"The combination of an AND gate with a NOT gate, so it is the opposite of an AND gate.",
OR Gate,"For the output to be TRUE, then either one or both of the inputs have to be TRUE.",
XOR Gate,"The output is TRUE only if either inputs are true, not both.",
XNOR Gate,"The combination of an XOR Gate with a NOT gate, so the opposite of a XOR Gate",
