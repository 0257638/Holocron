# Introduction
Exploring Web Development: Building a Personal Website with Flask, HTML, and CSS

Our goal? To build a personal website using Flask, HTML, and CSS.    

## The Tech Stack

### 1. Flask

- **What Is It?** Flask is a Python web framework. It’s lightweight, flexible, and perfect for small to medium-sized projects.
- **Why Use It?** Flask simplifies routing, handling requests, and managing templates. Plus, it integrates seamlessly with Python.

### 2. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)

- **What Is It?** HTML is the language of the web. It structures content, defines headings, paragraphs, links, and more.
- **Why Use It?** Without HTML, there would be no web pages. It’s the foundation of everything we see online.

### 3. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

- **What Is It?** CSS adds style and visual appeal to our HTML. It controls fonts, colors, layouts, and animations.
- **Why Use It?** CSS turns plain text into beautiful, well-designed web pages. It’s the artist’s palette for our website.

## Features We’ll Build

1. Resume Builder
    
    - Users can input their resume details (education, work experience, skills).
    - Flask handles form submissions, and the data is stored securely.
    - The resume dynamically appears on the website.
2. Shopping Cart
    
    - Whether you’re selling products or just simulating e-commerce, the shopping cart feature is essential.
    - Users can add items, view their cart, and calculate totals.
3. To-Do List
    
    - Stay organized with an interactive to-do list.
    - Add tasks, mark them as completed, and edit as needed.
    - Data persists even if the browser is closed.
4. Navigation
    
    - A sleek menu guides users to different sections of the website.
    - From the homepage to the resume builder, everything is accessible.


Remember, mistakes are part of the process. Embrace them, learn from them, and enjoy the journey. Happy coding!
