# Assessment Overview

> [!important] Regularly update your fork of the Holocron. This page may be updated throughout assessment week.

This is a **written report** responding to the scenario you've been given. You have a short amount of time to finalise the report. 

While the report is not *directly* related to the classwork and project, the purpose of this report is to show the links to real-world situation/s. You should **absolutely** use your project as evidence to include (screenshots, code, etc as necessary).

This assessment will require careful research and analysis. Use time to research the topics first, then write it up. 

Keep in mind the word limit.

# General Advice

> [!info] Use your in-class project as the main resource

**Read the Rubric** This is the document that will be used to evaluate your submission. Make sure you cover everything.

**Research, Research, Research!** Any claim you make in the report needs to be backed up with a reference. Do you discuss the sales figures for 2024? Reference! You say "PHP is better than Python for website development"? Reference! You mention that the sky is blue? Reference!

The rule of thumb for academic reports: Don't state a fact without references.

**Style of writing**. This is a technical document. Do not write an essay. Keep to facts. And be technical.

**Audience** Keep in mind the intended audience of the report. 

**Word Limit** Keep to the word limit (Â± 10%). Images don't count towards the word limit, so use them wisely.
