> [!info]- Project Overview
> Exploring Web Development: Building a Personal Website with Flask, HTML, and CSS
> Our goal? To build a personal website using Flask, HTML, and CSS.    
> ## The Tech Stack
> ### 1. Flask
> - **What Is It?** Flask is a Python web framework. It’s lightweight, flexible, and perfect for small to medium-sized projects.
> - **Why Use It?** Flask simplifies routing, handling requests, and managing templates. Plus, it integrates seamlessly with Python.
> - ### 2. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)
> - **What Is It?** HTML is the language of the web. It structures content, defines headings, paragraphs, links, and more
> - **Why Use It?** Without HTML, there would be no web pages. It’s the foundation of everything we see online.
> - ### 3. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
> - **What Is It?** CSS adds style and visual appeal to our HTML. It controls fonts, colors, layouts, and animations.
> - **Why Use It?** CSS turns plain text into beautiful, well-designed web pages. It’s the artist’s palette for our website.
> - ## Features We’ll Build
> 1. Resume Builder
> 	1. Users can input their resume details (education, work experience, skills).
> 	2. Flask handles form submissions, and the data is stored securely.
> 	3. The resume dynamically appears on the website.
> 2. Shopping Cart
> 	1. Whether you’re selling products or just simulating e-commerce, the shopping cart feature is essential.
> 	2. Users can add items, view their cart, and calculate totals.
> 3. To-Do List
> 	1. Stay organized with an interactive to-do list.
> 	2. Add tasks, mark them as completed, and edit as needed.
> 	3. Data persists even if the browser is closed.
> 4. Navigation
> 	1. A sleek menu guides users to different sections of the website.
> 	2. From the homepage to the resume builder, everything is accessible.
> Remember, mistakes are part of the process. Embrace them, learn from them, and enjoy the journey. Happy coding!
