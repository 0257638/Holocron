# Welcome to Week 7

- Assignment!
- VET!
- Shopping Cart!

note: The next few weeks will focus on these three topics. The practical aspect will be the shopping cart app within the ANH project. 
The second assignment is due after the holidays, and each week there will be sections to focus on, so it's not all left to the last minute.
You will also be able to complete some of the VET competencies for this unit.
