>The aim of this weeks work is to enable ANH to allow for new shopping lists to be created. We have already created the databases, models, and forms for the shopping lists and even shopping list items to be C.R.U.D(ed) now the templates need to be made for the website to function and app.py needs to be updated

# Templates
