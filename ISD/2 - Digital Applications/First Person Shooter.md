Welcome to this tutorial on building a First-Person Shooter (FPS) game using Godot.   
  
This tutorial is designed to guide you through the process of creating an FPS game from scratch, providing step-by-step instructions and explanations along the way.  
  
Godot is a powerful, open-source game engine that is highly flexible and customisable, making it an excellent choice for game development.   
  
It supports a variety of platforms and offers a unique and intuitive scene system.    
  
In this tutorial, we will cover key aspects of game development such as setting up the player character, implementing movement and shooting mechanics, creating enemies, and designing levels.   
  
We will also delve into more advanced topics such as raycasting and scripting.    
  
By the end of this tutorial, you will have a fully functional FPS game that you can further customise and expand upon.   
  
> These instructions are written for Godot v4.2.2
